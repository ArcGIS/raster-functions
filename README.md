# ArcGIS Raster Functions

This repository houses *raster function templates* (as .rft.xml files) that chains multiple *raster functions* and describes a powerful image processing operation. Templates can be very easily applied on single raster dataset, a mosaic dataset, or an image service to enable on-the-fly processing. This repository also contains new *raster functions* written in Python that extend the image processing capabilities of ArcGIS. 

Jump to the [Resources](https://github.com/ArcGIS/raster-functions/blob/master/README.md#resources) section for links to pages that elaborate on these concepts.

## Requirements

* ArcGIS 10.3
* Python 2.7 or above (if you plan to modify or create Python raster functions)
