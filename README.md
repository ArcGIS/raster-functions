# ArcGIS Raster Functions

This repository houses modern image processing and analytic tools called **raster functions**. 
Raster functions are *lightweight* and process only the pixels visible on your screen, in memory, without creating intermediate files. 
They are *powerful* because you can chain them together and apply them on huge rasters and mosaics on the fly. 

In this repository, you will find useful **function chains** (*.rft.xml) created by the Esri community. 
You can create custom raster functions in Python that work seamlessly with the several dozen functions that ship with ArcGIS. 

Jump to the [Resources](https://github.com/ArcGIS/raster-functions/blob/master/README.md#resources) section 
for links to pages that elaborate on creating function chains and customized functions.
